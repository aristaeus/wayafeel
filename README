README
    Wayafeel is a word creation program. It basically takes phonemes and joins them together to create new and unique words. The files in data/phoneme have lists of which phonemes go together to create pronounceable words, however this still needs some fine tuning. The files in data/grapheme have lists of possible graphemes for each phoneme, but this is still pretty useless.

CHANGELOG v 0.2
	- Wayafeel now accepts command line arguments for the seed. For example, ./wayafeel 42 would run the program with a seed of 42.
	- Added comments to source code.
